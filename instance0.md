# DarkLight ``instance: 0``

All of the code in this repository is the same code that ``instance 0`` uses, DarkLight ``instance 0`` will be
considered the offical DarkLight instance. ``instance 0`` requires a special key to use, this is done so that only
specific people are able to use it (and reduce server strain). This instance (at the moment) is intended to be used by
people who care about the issues DarkLight intends to deal with and has a somewhat good understanding of how DarkLight
works.

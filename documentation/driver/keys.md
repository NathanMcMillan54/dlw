# DLU keys

DarkLight is not and likely will not be open to everyone to easily use ([motivation](link)), to be able to use
DarkLight a person would need a valid key to start using it. This key will be used to generate a user Id which will be
asscoiated with the device you use DarkLight on. Keys can only be used by a single person, after connecting to a
distributor for the first time that key can never be used again.

### Getting a New Key

When there have been significant changes to ``darklight_driver`` it is recommended that you [update](updating.md)
``darklight_driver`` on your device. Since your original key will be invalid you will need to get another one, there
is an [information server](../information_servers.md#new-key-server) dedicated to getting new DLU keys. Every month a
DarkLight user will be able to receive two keys, one should be used for updating ``darklight_driver`` and the other
could be given to someone else so they can start using DarkLight.
